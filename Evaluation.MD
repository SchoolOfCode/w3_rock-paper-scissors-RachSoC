**Rock Paper Scissors Challenge**

##How It Started...

Not well at first! I got in to the mindframe that I needed to catch up and go through each of the resources on the repos to be able to complete the challenge. What ended up happening was that I got bogged down with too much information I wasn't doing the do... 

The group and the pair I was in at the time were in a similar situation, behind on the repos and trying to find time to fit it in, because of this, none of us were forthcoming in meeting up and working collabortively which probably hindered us all. _lesson learnt. 


##Getting myself out of procrastination mode... 

As with all tasks that you put off, I was procrastinating with everything else. I got away from the repos and started to watch tutorials and coding alongside it, which brought back the enjoyment of doing the do and having clarification at the same time. 

I also enjoyed the mindset talk on the Saturday session, it made me sit back and evaluate how I have been dealing with things on the course, so that really helped. 

##How it ended...

Overall, I am pleased with my game once I eventually completed it. I feel like the next time round, I will take the challenge in bite sized chunks rather than in one or two big sessions. I am now pretty much caught up with where I should be in regards to the repos and tasks. 

I have learnt things on tutorials that have then been on the repos (vice versa) and its solidfied my learning - I am still getting my head around all things DOM but it will come with plenty more practice. 

I have also learnt the 'Switch' statement, I find them easier to use then 'If's'
